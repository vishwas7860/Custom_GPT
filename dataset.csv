Alaish, M.D., joined the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in 2015 to co-lead The Hopkins Resource for Intestinal Vitality and Enhancement (THRIVE), a multidisciplinary program dedicated to the study and care of children with short bowel syndrome, a condition marked by insufficient gut tissue or poor gut function due to acquired or congenital diseases.  Alaish, an associate professor of surgery and surgical director of THRIVE, is a leading authority on pediatric intestinal disorders. Prior to Johns Hopkins, he worked at the University of Maryland, where in 2009 he launched a pediatric intestinal rehabilitation program.""Dr. Alaish has an impressive track record not only as a pediatric surgeon but also as a prolific researcher whose clinical encounters and surgical experiences have driven him to study the mechanisms behind the diseases he sees in clinic and in the operating room,"" says David Hackam, M.D., Ph.D., Johns Hopkins' pediatric surgeon-in-chief.""This combination of clinical acumen and scientific curiosity make Dr. Alaish a perfect fit for a place like the Johns Hopkins Children's Center, the cradle of pediatric academic medicine in this country.""Alaish's interest in short bowel syndrome was sparked by his clinical encounters in the neonatal intensive care unit during his fellowship. Originally, Alaish had set out to study and develop treatments for liver damage caused by a condition known as cholestasis - the abnormal and often-corrosive backup of fat-dissolving bile in the liver that scars the organ over time. Cholestasis and related complications, which claim the lives of thousands of newborns each year, are most commonly seen in babies born with a rare condition known as biliary atresia, marked by malformed bile ducts that prevent the normal drainage of bile from the liver into the intestines. However, during his rounds Alaish noticed that bile backup was also rather common among babies with short bowel syndrome and among premature babies who require intravenous nutrition known as TPN. Some babies on TPN would develop severe cholestasis and some would do just fine, Alaish observed, and physicians had no way of predicting which course a baby would take. Suspecting that genes were at play, Alaish took his questions to the lab. There, Alaish and colleagues found that mice carrying certain genes were more prone to developing cholestasis.Then something else caught his attention: Animals with cholestasis had leakier intestinal walls that made it easier for dangerous gut bacteria to escape into the bloodstream and cause serious invasive infections, a common and dreaded complication seen in infants. In addition, Alaish noticed that animals with such leaky walls had abnormal bacterial content in their guts. The gut harbors trillions of bacteria - some of them beneficial, some of them potentially harmful - that live in a delicate balance. However, a disruption in this equilibrium can fuel overgrowth of ""bad"" germs. So if leaky intestinal walls and altered bacterial population in the gut occurred hand in hand, Alaish's next question became: ""Which comes first?""Alaish says he plans to pursue that answer at Johns Hopkins, both in the lab and in clinic. The insights, he says, could lead to more effective and less toxic treatments for intestinal infections than traditional antibiotic therapy. In addition to promoting bacterial resistance and making pathogens impervious to drugs, antibiotics can encourage the growth of hard-to-treat fungal infections.""Being at Johns Hopkins will allow me to build on my previous research and clinical expertise, take my scientific pursuits to the next level, and, hopefully, benefit more patients and have greater impact,"" Alaish says. ""Improving patient outcomes through research in the lab and in clinic is at the very heart of THRIVE.""A native of Maryland, Alaish earned his undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering from Duke University and medical degree from the University of Maryland. He completed a surgical internship and surgical residency at the Medical College of Virginia, followed by a fellowship in pediatric surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. He went on to become assistant professor of surgery at Columbia University in New York and at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Alaish was division chief of pediatric surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital at New York until 2002.In 2002, Alaish became director of the pediatric chest wall reconstruction program at the University of Maryland, where he also went on to found and lead the pediatric intestinal rehab program. He led the division of pediatric surgery at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore from 2006 until 2015.In addition to intestinal surgery, Alaish performs a variety of surgeries for newborn anomalies as well as esophageal, gastrointestinal and biliary reconstruction and minimally invasive surgery on infants and children of all ages. He also specializes in the correction chest wall deformities.Alaish has been voted one of ""America's Top Surgeons"" by the Consumers' Research Council of America five times, including most recently in 2014.He is married to Laura M.

Broadway Baltimore, MD 21231","Richard F. Ambinder, M.D., Ph.D., currently serves as the James B. Murphy Professor of Oncology and the Director of the Division of Hematologic Malignancies at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. He is program co-leader of the Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program and leads the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) site at Johns Hopkins and the AMC Translational Sciences Working Group nationally. Dr. Ambinder graduated from Harvard College with a Bachelor’s degree in biochemistry, after which he received his medical degree from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine before completing his residency at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.  He also earned his Ph.D. in pharmacology from the Johns Hopkins University, and completed his oncology fellowship at Johns Hopkins. Within the clinic, Dr. Ambinder is active in the treatment of lymphoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma.Dr. Ambinder’s research is focused on exploring opportunities to prevent or treat cancer with viral infections.  Virus-associated tumors are among the most common malignancies in certain populations and regions. For instance, Burkitt's lymphoma (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma (KSHV) are common in equatorial Africa, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (EBV) is common in southern Chinese populations or those with southern Chinese origins, and immunoblastic lymphomas (EBV) are common in immunocompromised patients (organ transplant recipients, AIDS patients, etc).  Thus, Dr. Ambinder’s new approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment stand to have a direct impact on the lives of cancer patients around the globe.Additionally, the study of how viruses can impact these tumors is important in creating model systems for the development of new approaches to cancer care. Currently, many immunotherapies target unidentified antigens, making the measurement of relevant immune responses problematic at best.  However, in EBV-associated tumors the antigens are well defined, thus allowing the Ambinder lab to define the epitope-specific cellular immune responses. As a result of this breakthrough, interventions designed to alter immune response —whether they be vaccine based interventions, adoptive immunotherapy interventions, or pharmacologic interventions — may all be assessed in terms of relevant surrogate markers. Much in the same way the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma with radiotherapy and chemotherapy paved the way for the modern approach to cancer treatment more broadly, the treatment of EBV-associated tumors (including Hodgkin's lymphoma) may pave the way to the more generalized use of these modalities to treat a myriad of cancer types.",https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/richard-ambinder

I maintain clinical and teaching activity in a variety of settings such as the MGH emergency psychiatry service, the outpatient clinic where I see psychiatry patients with comorbid medical conditions, and in the Clinical Evaluation Center (CEC - admissions unit) at McLean Hospital. Academic interests include developing clear clinical training expectations in the form of publishable goals and objectives in core competency language. I developed an innovative leadership seminar for Chief Residents within the MGH/McLean residency which the APA uses for its annual Executive Leadership Program for chief residents. Additionally, the training program's curriculum design under my leadership is based on an integrated, longitudinal approach to the clinical requirements so that the training is less modular and more capable of complexity and depth as each year of training progresses. This was demonstrated by the inclusion of the internship year as an integral part of the training program starting in 2005 for more longitudinal integration of psychiatry with medicine. Additionally, I teach various seminars including: a) PGY-1 reading seminar, b) PGY-1 History of Psychiatry Seminar, and c) Chief Resident Leadership Seminar. Current research projects include studying and teaching leadership, simulation in residency training, and integrating mindfulness training in residency education for both burnout prevention and leadership development. As part of my leadership in residency training, I serve on the MGH Executive Committee Of Training and Education (ECOTE), Partners Education Committee (PEC), and on the Executive Council of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatry Residency Training (AADPRT).
